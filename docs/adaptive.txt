Description of an adaptive scheduler simulation experiment.

The basic premise here is that the horizon length should be related to both the stability period of the environment and to the volatility.

Where the environment is stable we can use a long horizon. Where the volatility is low (define) we can also use a longer horizon. The voltility here must measure the potential to change the schedule score - ie a load of low valued new groups can be ignored we need the new groups to be high scoring.

Method.

Set up a phase2 model as a base. Run the model with env modified by a range of stability settings and at the same time run it with a range of volatility settings. 

The result should be a plot of improvement over base (super-stable, all vol-events added at start) wrt x-axis showing env stability and y-axis showing volatility measure ie a contour plot.

We then need to generate thes eplots for various attempts at scheduling - 
(1) using BDS
(2) using different H on QLAS/ELAS
(3) most importantly using an adaptive scheduler


The later AS needs to be able during its execution to look at the information from the env and vol models as to how volatile and unstable the situation is - we infact cheat here and allow the scheduler unrestricted access to this scenario  which we have pre-defined. A real scheduler would have to deduce this for itself somehow!!!
