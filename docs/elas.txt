Some things needed before QLAS or ELAS or ALAS can be used for real.


Needs to run in background rather than on demand - but may want to be able to nudge it into running a sweep.
It may also run at some pre-defined fraction of horizon e.g at 75% of way thro.

How do we get the horizon value into the decision ?

What search mech to use - not QLAS - something more optimal (min-energy) or (sim-annealing) or (genetic).

What rule/mech used to allow volatile events to sequester sequence ?

Do we allow any flexibility/contingency in the devised schedule ?
-i.e. tree results or work out possible breakpoints based on predictions !

What is the break policy - do we break and reschedule (with new horizon prediction) or 
carry on observing but with penalty scores.

Do we use EFR or just plain scores and how is EFR implemented (ie decay time?).

How many planning layers - mission/tactical ? 
-will need extra metric generators for these as they use longer term calculations.
-will need to be able to calculate these things when volatile events are recieved
ie the MP and TP need (immediate?) notification when significant VEs occur 
- (significant) - this may mean that they get filtered updates.

feedback from scheduler to planning layers - ie to let planning know we are actually doing/done a specific group.
- maybe they are just registered as sched/exec update listeners ?

Interesting offside issue - some way to compute roughness of search-space - a useful quantity to have in sched gui display !

Planing layers - which metrics appropriate at each level ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner	       (ID)	Period		Metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategic      (SP)	1 semester	none identified as yet.
Tactical       (TP)	1 wk - 1 mth    PC (program completion), RS (resource sharing) - these are opposites!
Mission	       (MP)	1 night		TD (target demand),  YT (yield tracking), RN (remaining night = urgency).
Horizon Sched  (HS)	1 horizon	P (priority), OH/OA (optimal height/airmass), LM (lunar match), SM (seeing match).
