Scheduling notes relating to constraint satisfaction and fitness selection.

1. Data/AccountingModel tree pruning selection criteria. 

These are used by the Extractor to generate the candidiate list/queue.


1.1 Proposal vetos:

1. Null proposal (DM).
2. Outside activation period (DM).
3. Total time used up (AM).
4. Locked other than by RCS by mistake (DM).

1.2 Group veto:

1. Locked (DM).
2. Fixed group due within FG buffer timelimit (DM).
3. Slew time too long (DM).
4. Expired (DM).
5. FlexGroup is done (DM/HM).
6. Seeing/photom worse then minimum required (DM/ENV).
7. Insufficient time before any externally imposed constraint (CM).
8. Twilight time allowed (DM/AST).
9. Monitor pre-activation (DM).
10. Monitor outside window (DM).
11. Monitor already done current window (DM/HM).
12. Insufficient time allocation under requested conditions (DM/AM).
13. Expected execution time within constrained period (DM/EXM/CM).

1.3 Obs veto:

1. No target or configs defined (DM).
2. Height (too low/high) (DM/AST).
3. Lunar distance (dark and bright versions) (DM/AST).
4. Meridian time (DM/AST).
5. Instrument availability (DM/SDM?EXM).
6. A/G availability (DM/SDM).
7. Az limits (plus alt/rot) (DM/SDM?EXM).
8. Target visible over full execution time (DM/EXM).


2. Data/AccountingModel characterisation metrics.

These are the metrics generated by the Extractor for each Group in the
candidate list and supplied to the Selector to apply its fitness heuristic.
 
2.1 Group scoring:

1. Slew time (DM/EXM).
2. Lateness in project (DM).
3. Conditions time distibution in proposal relative to requested (DM/AM).
4. Fairness distibution of time between TAGs (DM/AM).
5. Condition matching (DM/ENV).
6. Adhoc priority (DM).
7. Proposal science priority within TAG (DM).
8. Monitor missed periods (DM/HM).


2.2 Obs scoring:

1. Height (DM/AST).
2. Transit height (DM/AST).
3. Lunar distance (DM/AST).


3. Some additional metrics or modifications of existing ones.

1. Centroid of group for height metric rather than individual target heights.
2. Estimate of time the group can be started up until (i.e. schedulable period).
   - typically time to set last target of group.
3. Westness/time-to-set related to above - conflicts with meridian closeness metric/veto.
4. Activation time, e.g. a fn that peaks during observable periods - can be sharp or shallow
   to reflect the user's desire to observe any-time-in-a-window or biased towards centre etc.
