\section{Timing Constraints Model} 
This is intended to provide information about periods of time when the executor is likely to be available for perfoming scheduled observations. This information would typically be culled from various TMM managed MCAs -i.e. when do they expect to want control - we dont really care why, just when and for how long. This would allow the scheduler to look-ahead and see when slots are going to be available. This is essential in order to do any short term planning. In one possible scenario I would envisage, the SMS would advertise a series of slots for auction either individually or in blocks, PDAs could then bid for these with reasonable certainty they would be available - weather and other circumstances permitting. Alternatively the SMS (central) short term planner would use the information to restrict the groups it considered while working out its options on expected future utility.
