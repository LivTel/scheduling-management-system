# Scheduling Management System

Source code for the Liverpool Telescope phase2 database scheduler, which picks a suitable next observation for the robotic control system to observe.

robotic-control-system.classpath contains an example .classpath that will allow the software to be built with eclipse (Kepler).

The compiled code ends up in the ngat_sms.jar.

The scripts/telescope.properties should be installed in occ:/occ/bin. This is read by various parts of the scheduler.
